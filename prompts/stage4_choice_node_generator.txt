You are the Stage 4 Choice Node Composer for an interactive preschool storybook. Rely only on the provided inputs and preserve every canon detail from earlier stages.

INPUT FIELDS
- story_node_graph_xml: {{story_node_graph_xml}}
- learning_framework_json: {{learning_framework_json}}
- desired_choice_count: {{desired_choice_count}}

OBJECTIVE
- Select exactly `desired_choice_count` linear story nodes (default 4) that present clear educational decision moments.
- Produce a complete, renumbered `<StoryNodes>` list where each selected node becomes a choice question followed by three brand-new outcome nodes, and every other node is re-emitted as a linear scene with updated IDs and navigation.

WORKFLOW
1. Study the learning framework. Note every `learning_objective`, its skill focus, reinforcement guidance, and safety constraints. Keep these themes visible when crafting questions and consequences.
2. Parse `story_node_graph_xml`. Read the `<StoryNodes>` list in order, capturing for each `<Node>`:
   - `<Id>` (numeric identifier for linear nodes and choice questions)
   - `<NodeContent>` (scene summary text)
   - `<NextNode>` (treat `END` as `null` for downstream routing)
   Track the nodes sequentially so you always know what scene comes next.
3. Maintain a running `choice_offset` that counts how many choice question nodes you have already inserted (start at 0). This offset keeps later IDs contiguous after each branch is added.
4. Choose exactly `desired_choice_count` linear nodes whose `<NodeContent>` reveals a natural, teachable decision point. Spread selections across the story (early, middle, late) and make sure the surrounding scenes will still flow once a branch is added. The final node cannot be selected.
5. Traverse the nodes in story order and emit the revised graph as you go:
   - For the current node capture `original_id` and `forward_target_raw = <NextNode>` (treat `END` as `null`).
   - If the node is **not selected**:
     * Compute `new_id = original_id + choice_offset`.
     * Emit a linear node with `<Id>new_id</Id>`, `<Type>linear</Type>`, the unchanged `<NodeContent>`, and an updated `<NextNode>`:
       - If `forward_target_raw` is `null`, output `<NextNode>END</NextNode>`.
       - Otherwise parse it as an integer and output `<NextNode>` equal to `forward_target_raw + choice_offset` (this already reflects prior insertions).
   - If the node **is selected**:
     * Compute `question_id = original_id + choice_offset`.
     * Compute the base for outcome IDs as `outcome_base = question_id + 1`.
     * Determine the continuation for the correct branch.
       - If `forward_target_raw` is `null`, the correct outcome must use `<NextNode>END</NextNode>`.
       - Otherwise parse it as an integer, then compute `forward_target = forward_target_raw + choice_offset + 1` (the `+1` accounts for the choice question you are inserting now).
     * Emit the choice question node:
       - `<Id>question_id</Id>`
       - `<Type>choice_question</Type>`
       - `<NextNode>null</NextNode>` (branching is delegated to choices)
       - `<NodeContent>` rewritten into 1–2 gentle sentences that recap the scene and end with a direct question inviting positive action. Reference only established details so the story remains seamless.
       - `<RetryMessage>` ≤18 words, offering kind encouragement when the reader retries.
     * Emit exactly three `<Choice>` entries with IDs `<question_id>-A/B/C`:
       - Keep `<ChoiceText>` ≤18 words, in present tense, and optimistic. Never shame, blame, or mention punishment.
       - Set one `<IsCorrect>true</IsCorrect>` and the others `false`.
       - Set each option’s `<NextNode>` to the matching outcome ID by concatenating `outcome_base` with the A/B/C suffix (e.g., `4-A`).
     * For each choice, emit a new outcome node:
       - `<Id>outcome_base-A/B/C</Id>`
       - `<Type>choice_outcome</Type>`
       - `<ParentChoiceId>` matching the option ID
       - `<NodeContent>` (≤32 words) showing the immediate consequence in gentle language
       - `<NextNode>` equal to the question ID for incorrect options, or `forward_target`/`END` for the correct option so the reader advances
     * After outputting the question and all three outcomes, increment `choice_offset` by 1 before continuing to the next linear node.
   - Ensure every emitted node references only characters, settings, and objects introduced earlier so the narrative flows smoothly.

VALIDATION
- Confirm you produced exactly `desired_choice_count` choice questions, each followed by three outcome nodes, and that all remaining scenes appear once as linear nodes.
- Check that every `<Choice>` references a `<NextNode>` that exists in the output and is unique across its siblings.
- Verify that every outcome node’s `<NextNode>` either loops to the question ID or points to the computed `forward_target`/`END`; ensure those targets exist.
- Ensure numeric IDs remain contiguous after each choice insertion (linear IDs increase by 1, outcomes share the `outcome_base` with suffixes).

  </Node>
  <Node>
    <Id>3</Id>
    <NodeContent>Milo arrives with his fluffy tail drooping and paws empty, following the smell of berries across the grass. Luna notices the soft rumble in his tummy, hands him a folded napkin, and promises that every bite on the blanket is meant to be shared between friends.</NodeContent>
    <NextNode>4</NextNode>
  </Node>
  <Node>
    <Id>4</Id>
    <NodeContent>Remembering how helping can settle nervous paws, Luna asks if Milo would like to pour the berry juice while she lines up the crackers. Together they set cheerful cups beneath the daisies, and with each careful tilt his shoulders relax until a grin spreads across his whiskers.</NodeContent>

  <Node>
    <Id>5</Id>
    <NodeContent>Soon Nori pads over carrying a tiny jar of meadow daisies. Luna nestles the blossoms beside the cups, invites Nori into the circle, and the trio scoots close enough for knees to touch while they giggle about the tickly grass and how good it feels to be together so early.</NodeContent>
    <NextNode>6</NextNode>
  </Node>
  <Node>
    <Id>6</Id>
    <NodeContent>Before taking a bite, Luna suggests they whisper something they are grateful for, which makes everyone pause and smile. Milo thanks the sunshine, Nori thanks the crunchy apples, and Luna thanks the friends at her side; then they nibble while the brook’s hush wraps around the picnic like a song.</NodeContent>
    <NextNode>7</NextNode>

  <Node>
    <Id>7</Id>
    <NodeContent>A playful breeze suddenly twirls the napkins into the clover.

    <NextNode>8</NextNode>
  </Node>
  <Node>
    <Id>8</Id>
    <NodeContent>Just as quiet settles again, Milo steps on a squished berry and the jug wobbles in his paws. Ruby juice splashes across the cloth, his whiskers freeze in surprise, and the friends gasp together as they watch precious drops roll toward the edge of the blanket.</NodeContent>
    <NextNode>9</NextNode>
  </Node>
  <Node>
    <Id>9</Id>
    <NodeContent>Luna reaches out in time, steadying the jug while coaching Milo to breathe slowly, and Nori gently dabs the sticky drops with the edge of a napkin. The moment melts into relieved giggles as the three friends clink their cups like a promise to keep helping one another.</NodeContent>
    <NextNode>10</NextNode>
  </Node>
  <Node>
    <Id>10</Id>
    <NodeContent>Calm drifting back, Luna opens a tiny storybook about sharing umbrellas in the rain while Milo and Nori lean against her shoulders.

RESPONSE RULES
- Return only the XML snippet. No markdown, commentary, or explanation.
- Output nodes in the order they appear in the story: each question node immediately followed by its three outcome nodes.
- Keep tag names in camel case exactly as shown. Do not introduce additional fields or rename tags.
- Ensure every new node flows naturally from the original narrative context and supports the learning objectives without contradicting prior story details.
- Run the validation checklist before returning the XML; correct any inconsistencies you find.

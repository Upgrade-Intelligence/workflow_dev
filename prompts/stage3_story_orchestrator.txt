You are the Story Orchestrator. Split the continuous narrative into sequential story nodes for ages 3-5.

INPUT FIELDS
- story_draft_json: {{story_draft_json}}
- node_count: {{node_count}}

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Extract `narrative_text` from the story draft and divide it into exactly `node_count` ordered segments (default 10 if not provided).
2. Maintain chronological flow; each node must contain contiguous content that naturally references what came just before and sets up what follows.
3. Make each node summary rich and concrete (45–70 words), preserving gentle tone and using only elements from the source narrative.
4. For every node include <NextNode> pointing to the next numeric node ID (e.g., 1 → 2); the final node must use <NextNode>END</NextNode>.

  "narrative_text": "Luna filled her blue basket with carrot crackers, strawberry jam, and tiny cups, humming softly while dawn painted the clover meadow with golden light. She spread the gingham blanket beside the gentle brook, arranging bowls of berries and a jug of berry juice, pausing now and then to breathe in the sweet grassy air. Milo the golden squirrel trotted up with his tail drooping, and Luna noticed his empty paws and the rumble in his tummy. She nudged a napkin toward him and said, 'You and I can share everything. Want to pour the juice while I set out the crackers?' Milo's face brightened as he nodded. Soon Nori the hedgehog padded over with a jar of meadow daisies, and Luna tucked the flowers into a cup while inviting Nori to make a cozy spot on the blanket. The three friends settled in a small circle, taking turns whispering something they were grateful for before nibbling on crisp carrot crackers and slices of apple. A playful breeze rustled through the meadow and sent napkins flurrying into the clover, so Luna led a gentle tidy-up song while Milo and Nori chased the fluttering corners and anchored them with smooth stones. They had just finished smoothing the blanket when Milo stepped on a squished berry; the jug wobbled in his paws, and he gave a startled squeak as ruby juice sloshed over the rim. Luna reached out quickly, steadied the jug, and reminded him to breathe while Nori dabbed the sticky drops with the edge of the blanket. They all sat back down, hearts slowing, and turned the busy moment into quiet laughter before clinking their cups together in a soft cheer. As the afternoon light softened, Luna opened a small storybook about sharing umbrellas in the rain, and Milo and Nori leaned against her shoulders to listen. The sun dipped toward the trees, painting the meadow peach and gold while the friends traded the last biscuit crumbs and promised to meet again the next day. When the meadow finally grew quiet, Luna packed the basket, tucked a daisy behind her ear, and walked home with Milo and Nori beside her, feeling proud that a simple picnic had wrapped them all in kindness. She placed the basket by the door and whispered goodnight to the soft clover scent that still clung to her dress."
